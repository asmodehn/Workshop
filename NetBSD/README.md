NetBSD Mupg 
===========

Mupg is a Tcl/Tk script, that I eventually grabbed from the internet. I customozed it, so it could be used on NetBSD.

This is just the beginning of a project to show the resource usage of a running program graphically, based on portable unix tools, but it s already extremely useful.
