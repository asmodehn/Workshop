This is an example hierarchy to be used along with CMake addons.

In this Hierarchy A depends on B, however B can be used without A.

Here we want to include B inside A, and not using B as a package to be found
already installed on the mahcine and use it.

B is what is called a "convenience library". Libtool used to build it as a
static library. However CMake doesnt support this type of use for static
libraries yet. So in the mean time we will use directly the source of the
convenience library.

This process has been coded in WkBuild.cmake
