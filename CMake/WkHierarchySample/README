This is an example hierarchy to be used along with Wk CMake addons.

In this Hierarchy A depends on B, however B can be used without A.

Here we want to embed B inside A, and not using B as a package to be found
already installed on the machine.

B is what is called a "convenience library". Libtool used to build it as a
static library. However CMake doesnt support this type of use for static
libraries yet. So in the mean time we will use directly the source of the
convenience library.

C is an external dependency that needs to be built before being used.
B relies on C, and needs to be linked to it for testing
