C++ Functor
===========

This project aimed at being the implementation of a C++ Functor class that would allow the client to call any function inside any class instance as if it was a simple usual function.
This is very useful for callbacks, old C-style static callbacks.
Currently supports 1 to 3 arguments.
The goal is not to evolve as a full "Signal-Slot" or similar behavior implementation though, because some good libraries already exists. Instead this should remain simple and easy to use.
