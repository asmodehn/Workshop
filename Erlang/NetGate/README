Introduction : NetGate
======================

This is a first prototype for a distribution protocol and algorithm,
that aims at making distribution, concurrent processes, connections, etc.
transparent and more intuitive.
It will implement at first an improved version of vector clock, as well as a test program.

Test application
================
A first application can be written, just as a chat with lines organized differently depending if the  concurrency has been detected or not. Example :


process A    |   process B
msg1         |   
             |    msg2
means that msg happens after processB had knowledge of process A's msg1

process A    |   process B
             |    msg1
msg2         |    
means that msg2 happens after processA had knowledge of process B's msg1

process A    |   process B
msg1         |   msg2
             |
means that msg1 and msg2 happened simultaneously,neither processA or processB had knowldge of each other msg or msg2 before sending heir own.

Implementation roadmap
======================

-First version : simple vector clock 2 processes. preconnected

-Second version : dynamic vector clock inspired by interval tree clocks, up to 8 participants, who can be dynamically connected

-Third version : let s see
